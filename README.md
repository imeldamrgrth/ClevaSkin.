# ClevaSkin
ClevaSkin is a deep learning-based system for automatic classification of skin diseases from images using transfer learning and explainable AI. The project leverages a fine-tuned MobileNetV2 architecture to classify 16 categories of skin conditions, including normal skin and non-skin images, while providing visual explanations through Grad-CAM.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, covering data exploration, dataset balancing, preprocessing, model training, fine-tuning, evaluation, and interpretability.
